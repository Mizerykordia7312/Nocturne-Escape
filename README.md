# Nocturne escape - Escape room website

## About the Project

This project is one of my first. It showcases a website designed to encourage visits to an escape room. In this project, I used Sass, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript.

I aimed to keep the website in a dark theme with a touch of humor.

## Features
- Responsive layout
- Styled with Sass for modular and maintainable CSS
- Interactive elements enhanced with JavaScript
